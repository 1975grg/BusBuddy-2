Bus Buddy Project Document (Finalized MVP)
Overview

Bus Buddy is a real-time bus and shuttle tracking platform built for schools, hospitals, airports, hotels, and other institutions.

It gives administrators a simple way to set up routes and vehicles, lets drivers easily start and run their trips, and enables riders (students, families, employees, or guests) to track buses live with proactive notifications.

The MVP is designed to be feature-complete enough for deployment across multiple industries right away, while still keeping the experience clean, intuitive, and reliable.

Core Users

Organization Admins – set up and manage routes, vehicles, branding, and access.

Drivers – activate and operate routes with minimal interaction.

Riders/Viewers – students, families, employees, or guests who follow buses live.

Super Admin – platform owner, overseeing all organizations.

Key Features
For Admins

Multi-organization support (each school, hospital, or hotel is siloed).

Route editor: create and reorder stops (2 for shuttles, 20+ for school buses).

Default “Only Active” filter on all lists (routes, stops, vehicles).

Optional vehicle assignment (bus/shuttle numbers).

Access tools: generate QR codes, magic links, or passwords; print QR sheets.

Branding: upload organization logo and set brand colors.

Token management: revoke remembered devices or reset access (e.g., each semester).

For Drivers

Login once (no repeated password prompts).

Default route is preselected (changeable if needed).

Giant buttons: Start Trip, Pause/Resume, End Trip.

Live map showing bus position and next stop ETA.

GPS streaming every few seconds (offline caching and backfill).

Automatic stop advancement using geofencing—driver doesn’t need to manually mark stops.

Optional issue reporting (free-text).

For Riders

Access via QR code, link, or password (if required).

“Remember me”: route remembered on device, no repeated prompts.

Ability to save multiple default routes (families with more than one student, employees with multiple shuttles).

Auto-loads the live bus map—no need to click “Find My Bus.”

ETA clearly displayed for each stop.

Notifications:

Email (core)

SMS (core MVP)

Push notifications (core MVP)

Riders choose when to be alerted (X minutes before, or when the bus is Y meters away).

Option to set a default stop per route for faster tracking.

Notification System (Core MVP)

Proactive alerts by email, SMS, and push notifications.

Riders choose notification thresholds.

System calculates ETA in real time, triggers alerts automatically, and prevents duplicates.

Admins can view and manage notification activity.

Route Types

Shuttles: simple 2-stop back-and-forth loop.

School buses: many sequential stops in one direction.

Both handled in the same editor.

Branding

Each organization can upload a logo and set brand colors.

Branding applies to the rider-facing map and to QR printouts, so the experience feels like the school/hospital/hotel’s own.

Privacy & Safety

Data siloed by organization.

Bus location visible only while a trip is active.

Tokens and device-based remembered access can be revoked anytime.

Rider access requires a valid QR/link/password once, then is remembered.

User Experience Principles

Zero extra clicks: Riders immediately see live buses.

Defaults everywhere: Default routes and stops for drivers and riders.

Clean simplicity: Drivers only see trip controls. Riders see a map with ETA. Admins see simple lists.

Consistency: Active filters applied by default to keep screens uncluttered.

Brandable: Each organization’s riders feel like it’s “their app,” not a generic tool.

Technology

Frontend: React + TypeScript + Tailwind.

Realtime backend: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Realtime DB).

Maps: MapLibre GL + OpenStreetMap.

Notifications: SendGrid (email), Twilio (SMS), Firebase Cloud Messaging (push).

Hosting: Firebase Hosting.
